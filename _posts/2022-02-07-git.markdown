Git is a version control system used broadly in the development world. The best way to learn git is though consistant usage. It's great to be mentored by a git expert. If you want to try learning on your own, [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) is a fantastic resource. 

Herr are common commands every git user will use.

Powerful git commands:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone [url]
git status
git add [file]
git diff
git diff --staged
git commit -m "[message]"
git log -p -2
{% endhighlight %}

I am facinated by git and can't wait to share more about it!
